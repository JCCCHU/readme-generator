# Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Good README Generator

This app offers the user a command-line interface to create READMEs for their projects.

After providing their Github username, the user is guided through a series of prompts to build out a basic README file.

While the program works at a fundamental level, there are some areas for improvements:

* The API call should have been abstracted out.
* If nothing was entered for a specific prompt, it shouldn't be a heading in the README.
* The way I used variables here ended up being quite confusing. From the beginning there should have been a separate object for storing the in-progress items.
* I don't think the program structure makes sense. There should have been a separate function for getting the user's Github username.
* There should be a way to actually display the user's profile picture and the badge but I haven't gotten it to work yet.
